### **Intro to *R***
R was developed by a group of statisticians who wanted an open-source alternative to the costly proprietary options that were (and still are) popular.

Because it was created by statisticians (instead of computer scientists), R has some quirky aspects to it that take some time to get used to.

***

### **Why *R***
R is mainly used for statistical analysis while Python provides a more general approach to data science.

R has now one of the richest ecosystems to perform data analysis.It is possible to find a library for whatever the analysis you want to perform. 

The rich variety of library makes R the first choice for statistical analysis, especially for specialized analytical work.

### **Setup *R* & *RStudio* on your local machine**

#### For installing R and RStudio head to the links below

> [R Downloadable Link](https://cloud.r-project.org/)

> [RStudio Downloadable Link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

#### Or Setup Using Anaconda 

##### Go ahead and enter these commands into your Anaconda Prompt & We'll be good to go.

> conda install r-essentials --yes

> conda install -c r rstudio --yes


### RStudio Environment 
![](C:\Users\KIIT\Desktop\Emp\GC\R_files//rStudio_img.jpg)

#### Now Check your working directory and then set it accordingly by entering these commands in the console given below.

> getwd('Current Location')

> setwd('Desired location')

### **Basics Of *R***

##### Data Types in R

So R has basically 4 data types :

* numeric: R by default stores a number as a double be it integer or decimal.To determine  a integer explicitly one has to put an *L* at the end of the number.

* character: a.k.a the string values could be anything inside "".

* complex: It is to store complex numbers in the form of a + b(i).

* Boolean: It can be either TRUE / FALSE.

```{r}

typeof(123)

typeof(123L)

typeof('Hello World')

typeof(2+3i)

```


*Indexing in R starts from 1 whereas in python it starts from 0.*

##### Variables

Rules for naming a variable in R:

* A variable name must start with a letter and can be a combination of letters, digits, period(.)and underscore(_). 

* If it starts with period(.), it cannot be followed by a digit.

```{r variables}

first_var <- 123

second_var <- 234

sum <- first_var + second_var

print(sum)

```
##### Concatenation

For concateneation of two strings we use paste() function.

```{r concatenate}

char_a <- 'Hello'
char_b <- 'World'

char_a

char_b

char_c <- paste(char_a, char_b)
char_c

```

##### Operators

In other programming language, it is common to use = as an assignment operator. In R, we can use both = and <- as assignment operators.

However, <- is preferred in most cases because the = operator can be forbidden in some context in R.

x <- 3 is equal to 3 -> x

*<<- is a Global Assigning Operator*

Arithmetic Operators
![](C:\Users\KIIT\Desktop\Emp\GC\R_files//arith.jpg)

```{r arithmetic}


```

Logical Operators
 
![](C:\Users\KIIT\Desktop\Emp\GC\R_files//logical.jpg)

```{r logical}


```

Math Functions 

Basic math functions like max(), min(), sqrt() etc.
```{r math}
max(5, 10, 15)

min(5, 10, 15)

#returns square root
sqrt(225)

#returns the absolute value of a number
abs(-4.7)

#rounds a number to its upwards integer
ceiling(1.4)

#rounds a number to its downwards integer
floor(1.4)

```

##### Loops 

###### while loops syntax

```{r while}

i <- 1
while (i < 6) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}

```

###### for loops syntax 

```{r for}

for (x in 1:10) {
  print(x)
}

```


##### Conditional Statements

* Nested If statements
```{r conditional}
x <- rnorm(1)

if (x > 1) {
  print("")
  if (x > 20) {
    print("and also above 20!")
  } else {
    print("but not above 20.")
  }
} else {
  print("below 10.")
}

```

* Else-if Statements 
```{r conditional_1}
x <- rnorm(1)

if(x>1){
 ans <- 'Greater than 1' 
}else if(x >= -1){
  ans <- 'Between -1 & 1'
}else{
  ans <- 'Less than 1'
}

print(x)  
print(ans)


```

##### In the above examples, we use conditinal statements to group the randomly generated number x (the rnorm function is similar to the random() fxn in python).
